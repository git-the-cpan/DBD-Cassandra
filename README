DBD-Cassandra

This module aids developers in connecting to Cassandra via the familiar
DBI interfaces. The current implementation is very incomplete, though
later releases will hopefully implement the full CQL3 language.

Right now this module is entirely written in Perl. Performance is not
very good, so this might become XS some day.

	perl Makefile.PL
